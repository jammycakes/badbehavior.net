        <strong><a href="http://bad-behavior.ioerror.us">Bad Behavior</a></strong>
        is one of the Internet's most trusted solutions for helping to prevent
        link spam and other malicious activity, from well-known sites to the
        smallest blogs. Bad Behavior complements other link spam solutions by
        acting as a gatekeeper, preventing spammers from ever delivering their
        junk, and in many cases, from ever reading your site in the first place.

        <strong>Bad Behavior .NET</strong> brings this technology to the world
        of ASP.NET for the first time. It plugs into any ASP.NET website,
        whether you use WebForms, ASP.NET MVC, SharePoint, or an off-the-shelf
        or custom content management system.
